# Quick start

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Initialize

If you want to write the documentation in the `./docs` subdirectory, you can use the `init` command.

```bash
docsify init ./docs
```

## Writing content

After the `init` is complete, you can see the file list in the `./docs` subdirectory.

* `index.html` as the entry file
* `README.md` as the home page
* `.nojekyll` prevents GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore

You can easily update the documentation in `./docs/README.md`, of course you can add [more pages](more-pages.md).

## Preview your site

Run the local server with `docsify serve`. You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
docsify serve docs
```

?> For more use cases of `docsify-cli`, head over to the [docsify-cli documentation](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli).

## Manual initialization

If you don't like `npm` or have trouble installing the tool, you can manually create `index.html`:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify@4/themes/vue.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script>
    window.$docsify = {
      //...
    }
  </script>
  <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/docsify@4"></script>
</body>
</html>
```




# The Future of Learning is Mobile
## The learning landscape has changed. And how and what we teach learners will need to adjust to keep up to date with the demands of the "next normal."

With the recent advancements in mobile technology, anywhere-anytime-continuous learning isn't out of reach.

As the world races to a new future, employers, educators, and teachers alike must be prepared to be innovative and create learning programs that suit the future needs of their students. So optimize your eLearning courses for mLearning today!

### Flash cards are one of the classic study tools, and for good reason – they promote studying through active recall, which is one of the practices through which our brains learn most effectively.
