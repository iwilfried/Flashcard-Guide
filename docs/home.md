# The Future of Learning is Mobile
## The learning landscape has changed. And how and what we teach learners will need to adjust to keep up to date with the demands of the "next normal."

With the recent advancements in mobile technology, anywhere-anytime-continuous learning isn't out of reach.

As the world races to a new future, employers, educators, and teachers alike must be prepared to be innovative and create learning programs that suit the future needs of their students. So optimize your eLearning courses for mLearning today!

### Flash cards are one of the classic study tools, and for good reason – they promote studying through active recall, which is one of the practices through which our brains learn most effectively.
